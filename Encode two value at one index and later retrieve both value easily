see this question as reference in case of any doubt

let at ith index value is 'a' and wanted to make it 'b' but in later value 'a' will be needed in that case

m= max_element+1

at_ith_index=a+b*m;

when value 'a' is needed ...use ith_index_value % m
and when 'b' is needed ...use ith_index_value/m
